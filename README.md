Jalo is a top-down third person shooter. It runs in Java. It requires Java 1.6, a keyboard, and a mouse to play.

=================================================
3. Achievements and Challenges

In Jalo, these are specific tasks that earn you new stuff and experience. Achievements are listed when you unlock them in "Statistics", but Challenges are hidden. Challenges directly unlock items in the Armory. I would try all sorts of things to get the Challenges, like manually reloading, or surviving several rounds without taking health damage. Achievements.txt holds the specific instructions on how to get achievements. There are 49 achievements and 25 challenges. Good luck getting them all!
==================================================
4. HUD

Your weapon, attachment, and ammo are in the top left corner. Your Score is in the top right. Your health is clearly denoted. Your Rank and Experience are on the bottom left. The playlist information is on the bottom right.

The game and action are obviously in the middle.
==================================================
5. Game Mechanics

Jalo continues indefinitely until you die. It uses Halo's Firefight mechanics. You must kill all enemies on the screen. Defeating all enemies in a certain stage completes a Wave. There are 5 Waves in a Round, and 3 Rounds in a Set. As you advance, the enemies get more difficult to defeat. You have energy shields and health. Your shields help you take damage before dying. Energy shields recharge after not taking damage for a while. Health does not recharge. Killing enemies earns you exp, which increase your rank. You unlock weapons as you earn higher ranks. Some ranks require a higher Level. To increase your level, play the "Level Up!" playlist. You cannot edit the difficulty in this playlist.
==================================================
6. Saving Progress

Your data is saved after every game as Jalo.sav. Your gamertag is saved to "YourGamertag.txt". You can edit your gamertag here or in The Armory. While it may seem tempting to alter your save file with a text editor to get all weapons or max experience, I STRONGLY advise against it. Cheaters are Losers. Trust me.
=======================================================
7. Known issues

The game lags on occasion to clean up memory. However, in some instances, the game lags HORRIBLY. Simply exit and restart the game to clear this up. Your processor simply needs a rest. This game is very demanding on CPU for a Java game. Be advised! When this horrible lag occurs, quit without saving if possible or your save will become corrupt.

Special thanks to Mr. Babb for suggesting the concept of a top-down 3rd person shooter.

I do not claim rights to the audio or sprites used in this game as they belong one to their respective owners.

Thank Bungie for indirectly making this game and go play some Halo: Reach when you have a chance.
